#line 1 - shabang
#shabang - telling bash this is ruby.  exec files need to know to interpet the files as ruby. 
#exec files run through the bash shell and need to be told this is a ruby file. 
#will need the shabang to deploy gems. 


#line 4 - require vs require_relative
#require is a method that is used when you want to reference and execute code that is not 
#written in your current file. The method takes in a path in the form of a string as 
#an argument and there are two ways the string can be formatted â€” either as an
#absolute path or a shortened name.
#Listing your directory in $LOAD_PATH allows for flexibility and could load your external 
#file even if you were to move it into a different folder. 
#Each of these lines represents a directory on your computer where Ruby files are stored. 
#If you use require anywhere in your application (e.g. require "digest") then Ruby will 
#look for a Ruby file with the same name (e.g. digest.rb) in each of these directories. 
#It will load the first file with this name that it can find.
